# Mapping `valthrun-driver.sys` with @Valthrunners' script
1. Download **controller.exe** and **valthrun-driver.sys** from <https://github.com/WolverinDEV/Valthrun/releases/latest>
2. Download **kdmapper.exe** and **run.bat**  from <https://github.com/valthrunner/Valthrun/releases/latest> (*ATTENTION*: External source!)
3. If not already put everything (all .exe files and the .bat file) in the same folder
4.  Start CS2
5. Double click run.bat (every .exe file needs to be named correctly!!!)  
_for example controller (1).exe wont work they need to be named like above!_
1. Press **PAUSE/BREAK** key and configure Valthrun like you want (if you're missing that key check out: [Finding the PAUSE key](030_troubleshooting/overlay/050_pause_key.md))  
_if the Menu doesn't show maybe you are in fullscreen change to fullscreen windowed_
