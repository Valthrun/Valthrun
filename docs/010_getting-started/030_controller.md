# Starting the overlay
Once the kernel driver has been successfully loaded, and CS2 is up and running, 
you can start the Valthrun overlay by running `controller.exe`.  
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a terminal window.

Here's an example of what the overlay's interface might look like:

With these steps completed, you are now ready to use Valthrun and take advantage of its gameplay enhancements for Counter-Strike 2.  
Be sure to consult the project's documentation and support resources for more detailed information on its functionality and usage.
