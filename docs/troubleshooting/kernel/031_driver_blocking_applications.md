# General applications which might interfer with the kernel module
As manually mapping the kernel driver is something that is prohibited by many applications, including some unsuspecting ones, it's important to be aware of potential interference. Here is a list of commonly used applications that might interfere and should be closed or stopped before mapping the driver:
- Common games with anti-cheats
  - CS:GO / CS2 with Facit or ESEA
  - EAC (Apex, Fortnite, Rust)
  - Vanguard (Valorant)
- Anti virus applications
Note: Please do *not* permanently disable your AV.  
Only do it for the time of mapping the driver!
- Windows Defender
